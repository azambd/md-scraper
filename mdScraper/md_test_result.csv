I have gone to another pain clinic for 18 months. They didn't listen, didn't do anything for me, and treated me like I was just some one looking for a fix. I saw Dr. Puppala and his amazing group three times, three, the third time I cried. Not because I was in pain or frustrated because no one was listening, no, I cried because I walked out that door in 0 pain. NO PAIN I couldn't tell you how long it's been since I've said that. He is a MIRACLE DOCTOR. His staff is friendly, educated, sweet, kind, I could go on and on...... I will recommend him to everyone I know who needs help. Thank you, everyone, you guys are truly a blessing.",review-18677

The surgery relieved some pain, but much remained and new pain arrived. I was sent to pain management and at first I had a different doctor everytime and each tried something different instead of hearing what pain I felt or was I was feeling emotionally about my family's and my future. They insisted they knew what I was feeling and needed treated and how. But finally I Asked for Puppala specifically and he was/still is great. He listened to me, what and how I was feeling, not just physically, but the emotional side of the pain too. And, which is very important to me, didn't treat me like a drug addict for needing medicinal assistance. His nerve block injections/ablations worked better than any previous doctor and I'm so grateful for the ability to play and raise my 2 year old and 8 month old without worrying about the pain keeping me down. I literally just take tramadol on a daily basis as needed and sometimes way less than the prescribed daily amount depending on my activities. If you really want your life back, Dr. Puppala is who you want to see. Thank- you Dr. Puppala!",review-14716

He was knowledgae, helpful and empathetic of my pain. I could tell he truly cared and was sincere with all of his patients and compared with my last docter who told me to go to work after my onsite injury. When I couldn't even walk. I highly recommend anyone who is suffering from pain to go to this remarkable doctor!",review-13041

He understand that I did not want to have to rely on meds in order to feel better and offered me options as to what I wanted to do. He listened to me and agreed with me that he also did not want me to have to continue to see him or rely on the meds to feel better. It was reassuring for me and I am pleased with my care thus far.,review-2307

I've been to at least four other doctors for my back pain and none of them were doing the right kind of procedures for the pain I have - they just kept doing epidurals and more epidurals. Finally, I saw Dr. P who immediately told me he would recommend something different. He did nerve blocks to my joints and then cauterized those nerves, and now I'm 99% pain free in my back. I don't need to take any narcotics anymore, and I only take over-the-counter medications on a bad day when it rains or after playing golf. Thanks Dr. P!",review-1947
